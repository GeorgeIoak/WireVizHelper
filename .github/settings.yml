# GitHub Repository Settings Configuration
# 
# This file can be used with GitHub Apps like "Probot: Settings" or "Repository Settings"
# to automatically configure repository metadata.
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Install the "Settings" GitHub App from https://github.com/apps/settings
# 2. Grant it access to this repository
# 3. Trigger the sync by:
#    a) The app syncs automatically on first install (if this file exists)
#    b) Push any change to this file to the main branch
#    c) Run the "Sync Repository Settings" workflow from the Actions tab
#
# If settings don't update after installing the app:
# - Go to Actions tab → Run "Sync Repository Settings" workflow
# - Or make a small edit to this file and push to main
# - Or follow manual steps in .github/ABOUT-SETUP.md
#
# Alternatively, you can manually configure these settings through the GitHub web interface
# by clicking the gear icon next to "About" on the repository main page.
