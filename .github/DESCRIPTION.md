# Repository About Section Configuration

This file documents the recommended configuration for the repository's "About" section on GitHub.

## Issue

The "About" section on the GitHub repository page appears blank even though the repository has a comprehensive README.md file. This is because GitHub's "About" section is populated from **repository settings**, not from the README file itself.

## Solution

To populate the "About" section, you need to configure the following in your GitHub repository settings:

### Steps to Configure

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/GeorgeIoak/WireVizHelper
2. Click the ⚙️ (gear/settings) icon next to "About" on the right side of the repository page
3. Fill in the following information:

### Recommended Description

```
WireVizHelper extends WireViz to produce engineering-style drawing sheets with enhanced BOM handling and PDF output. Python-based with optional Windows executable.
```

### Recommended Website

```
https://github.com/GeorgeIoak/WireVizHelper/blob/main/docs/yaml-options.md
```

Or if you have a dedicated documentation site, use that URL instead.

### Recommended Topics

Add the following topics (tags) to help users discover your repository:

- `wireviz`
- `wiring-diagram`
- `engineering-drawings`
- `python`
- `graphviz`
- `cable-harness`
- `bom`
- `pdf-generation`
- `engineering-tools`
- `electrical-engineering`

## Additional Options

You can also configure:
- **Use your repository topics**: Check this box to make topics more prominent
- **Releases**: GitHub will automatically show the latest release
- **Packages**: If you publish packages, they'll appear here
- **Deployments**: If you have active deployments, they'll be listed

## Why This Matters

The "About" section helps users quickly understand your project and improves discoverability through GitHub's topic-based search. It appears prominently on your repository's main page and in search results.
